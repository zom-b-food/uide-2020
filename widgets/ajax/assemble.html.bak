						"description": "Learning a front-end framework is hard. \"Getting started\" tutorials cover the basics but you leave thinking, \"Okay, now how do I build something with this?\"The truth is, getting started tutorials aren't all that great for beginners. They're demos to highlight as many features as quickly as possible.They're great for showing off what a framework can do. They aren't so great for teaching you how to build web apps.The end result is a basic application that doesn't mimic what it's like building real applications as a front-end developer. You'll work with a mocked API and database. Application architecture isn't covered. Automated testing is skipped altogether.Trust me, I've been there. But those days are over. With The Angular Tutorial, you'll learn how to build applications using a real API and database. You'll leverage 3rd party APIs like Zomato, Google Places, and open-source libraries just as you would in a real job.The Angular Tutorial assumes you have no previous knowledge of the Angular framework. It starts at the very beginning.Every piece of code is explained and tested to make you interview ready. You'll begin with an introduction to how web applications work followed by an introduction to Angular to give you a good grasp on the basics. Then you'll learn how to setup a real database and API just as I've done at numerous companies ranging from venture capital, startups, Fortune 500 companies, and digital agencies working with companies like CNN, Turner Broadcasting System, NBC, Mazda, AutoTrader and The Home Depot. After that is a deeper dive into Angular where you'll build a real application with features like a signup page, a login page, a dashboard for authenticated users, and a calendar displaying lunch dates which you can show off on your resume or to your friends. You'll deploy this application to the web using Heroku so the proof of your work will be accessible to anyone. ? Forms - Template-driven forms or reactive forms? Don't worry, both are covered. ? E2E Testing - Fast and easy end-to-end testing of your application with Cypress. ? Unit Testing - Unit test your code with Karma and Jasmine. ? Services - Communicate with a backend using Angular's HttpClient and write your own interceptors. ? Authentication - Secure your application with JSON Web Tokens (JWT). ? Authorization - Learn to restrict sections of your application to authorized users. ? Module Architecture - Create dumb components, feature modules, and learn to break down an application into smaller parts. ? OSS Integration - Why re-invent the wheel? Learn to use open-source libraries to your advantage just as you would on the job. ? API Documentation - Learn how to read API documentation so you have the confidence going forward to work with any API. ? Deployment - Get your application onto the web. Learn how to build and deploy your Angular application to Heroku.",

Using real-world examples, case studies, and practical tips and tricks throughout, author Micah Godbolt introduces you to the four pillars of frontend architecture. He also provides compelling arguments for developers who want to embrace the mantle of frontend architect and fight to make it a first-class citizen in their next project. The four pillars include: Code: how to approach the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript of a design system Process: tools and processes for creating an efficient and error-proof workflow Testing: creating a stable foundation on which to build your site Documentation: tools for writing documentation while the work is in progress",

						"description": "“For Drupal to succeed, we need books like this.” –Dries Buytaert, Drupal founder and project lead “Drupal faces a common problem on the Web–the relative lack of new, high quality themes. Front End Drupal tackles this problem directly and is designed to help both experienced designers and rank novices get an understanding of how Drupal theming works. In fact, I’ll be the first to admit I learned a lot from this book.” – Dries Buytaert, Drupal founder and project lead The Practical, Complete Guide to Customizing Drupal Sites with Behaviors, Themes, and Templates Drupal is now the world’s #1 open source content management system: Thousands of individuals and organizations are using it to build and update Web sites of virtually every kind. As Web designers and developers adopt Drupal, they need ways to quickly customize the visuals and interactivity of their sites. Drupal offers powerful tools for doing so, but little guidance on using them effectively. Front End Drupal is the solution. In this book, two expert Drupal developers cover everything you need to know to create great visual designs and state-of-the-art interactivity with Drupal’s behaviors, themes, and templates. Front End Drupal is 100% focused on issues of site design, behavior, usability, and management. The authors show how to style Drupal sites, make the most of Drupal’s powerful templating system, build sophisticated community sites, streamline site management, and build more portable, flexible themes. You’ll also gain hands-on experience through several case studies that walk you through the customization of everything from page templates to Web site forums. Prepare and organize content so it’s easier to integrate into Drupal Web sites Structure Drupal page templates that are easy to work with Configure Drupal with the modules and browser tools you need to customize your site Utilize Drupal’s Starter Themes and themes converted from WordPress, Joomla!™, and Drupal 5.x Maximize the power and usability of Drupal’s content editing forms Build usable community sites with user profiles, comments, and user-generated content Use JavaScript™ to make your themes interactive and to enhance usability Create powerful animations and AJAX callbacks with jQuery, Drupal’s JavaScript library About the Web Site The accompanying site, frontenddrupal.com, contains all sample code and themes presented in this book.",

						"description": "Elm brings the safety and stability of functional programing to front-end development, making it one of the most popular new languages. Elm's functional nature and static typing means that run-time errors are nearly impossible, and it compiles to JavaScript for easy web deployment. This book helps you take advantage of this new language in your web site development. Learn how the Elm Architecture will help you create fast applications. Discover how to integrate Elm with JavaScript so you can update legacy applications. See how Elm tooling makes deployment quicker and easier. Functional programming offers safer applications with decreased runtime errors, but functional solutions that are type safe and easy to use have been hard to find, until the Elm language. Elm has the benefits of functional languages while compiling to JavaScript. This book provides a complete tutorial for the Elm language, starting with a simple static application that introduces Elm syntax, modules, and the virtual DOM, to exploring how to create a UI using functions. See how Elm handles the issues of state in functional languages. You'll continue to build up larger applications involving HTTP requests for communication. Integrate your Elm applications with JavaScript so you can update legacy applications or take advantage of JavaScript resources. Elm also provides built-in tooling to alleviate the tooling creep that's so common in JavaScript. This book covers Elm's deployment and testing tools that ease development confusion. Dive into advanced concepts including creating single-page applications, and creating performance improvements. Elm expert Jeremy Fairbank brings his years of web development experience to teaching how to use Elm for front-end development. Your web UIs will be faster, safer, and easier to develop with Elm and this tutorial. What You Need: You will need the latest version of Elm, 0.18, along with a browser to run the examples in this book.",

People want faster, more usable interfaces that work on multiple devices, and you need the latest tools and techniques to make that happen. This book gives you over 40 concise solutions to today's web development problems, and introduces new solutions that will expand your skill set---proven, practical advice from authors who use these tools and techniques every day. In this completely updated edition, you'll find innovative new techniques and workflows, as well as reworked solutions that take advantage of new developments. Web development is constantly changing, and you need to stay on top of your game. Discover a wide spectrum of web development techniques, from how to improve the way you present content, to solutions for data analysis, testing, and deployment. In this edition we introduce new tools, add new recipes, and modernize old ones. You'll use Vagrant to automate server setup, and you'll discover new ways to develop blogs and static sites. You'll learn how to use Grunt to script the deployment of your web project, and use Angular to build a single-page app. You'll learn how to make content stand out with simple cross-browser styles; create animations that work well everywhere without plugins; and create lightweight, responsive layouts. We'll show you how to use preprocessors like CoffeeScript and Sass; write tests for your code; use Git and Dropbox to collaborate; configure and secure the Apache web server; use virtualization to set up your own servers automatically; and much more. Whether you're new to front-end development, or you've got a few years of experience, you'll become a more versatile developer by finding out how---and why---to use these solutions in your next project. What You Need: Your favorite text editor, the most current version of Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome or Safari, and a working knowledge of HTML and JavaScript.

						"description": "J2EE FrontEnd Technologies: A Programmer's Guide to Servlets, JavaServer Pages, and Enterprise JavaBeans concisely and accurately describes what you need to know about effective enterprise development based on servlets, JSPs, and EJBs. Servlets, JSPs, and EJBs are the most important aspects of Java as it is used in the production of enterprise Web applications today. Lennart Jorelid's book concentrates on teaching programmers how to fit the various technologies together while spending as little time as possible on \"plumbing.\" Jorelid discusses servlet development and architecture, and he teaches developers how to integrate servlets into distributed enterprise systems with illustrated examples. He explains the architecture and implementation of JSPs—including introductory concepts such as using all built-in facilities of the JSP library and advanced topics such as creating your own custom actions using the JSP Tag Library API. Jorelid also addresses the open-source Struts framework from the Apache Software Foundation, which provides a powerful framework for J2EE Web application development by combining servlets and JSPs. And, finally, Jorelid explores the EJB programming paradigm, covering development and architecture of EJBs and J2EE integration and deployment. J2EE FrontEnd Technologies: A Programmer's Guide to Servlets, JavaServer Pages, and Enterprise JavaBeans provides developers with a unique approach to understanding the profound relationship between servlets, JSPs, and EJBs. Developers will gain a clear understanding of all three and will be able to harness this knowledge for their own real-world applications.",

						"description": "Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole—a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including: Syntax Objects Functions Inheritance Arrays Regular expressions Methods Style Beautiful features The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book. With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast. If you develop sites or applications for the Web, this book is an absolute must.",

Page was built using the UI-Kit framework with SCSS and Grunt.
Feel free to look at the Gruntfile.js to see how the final,
compiled css and js files are packaged.

Global and framework m.q. breakpoints are defined in
_mixins.scss and _mediaqueries.scss. Custom classes, media
queries and all framework overrides are in custom.scss. 

Project required Gotham Book font which is in _fonts-icons.scss
(the actual font is in the fonts folder). The only icons used 
are part of the fontawesome offering. Jquery is accessed
via CDN link used on the home page (home.html).

Thank you for viewing.
